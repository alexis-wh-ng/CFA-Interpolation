# Interpolation for Colour Demosaicing of Digital Cameras

During demosacing, a considerable amount of information is loss in the reconstruction of the original image from a camera raw CFA data. The goal is to investigate and develop an algorithm that can best estimate the original RGB image from a CFA data.

Bilinear, DLMMSE and Matlab built-in 'demosaic(...)' are experimented.
